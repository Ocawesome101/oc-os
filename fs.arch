  \\\"F:events.txt\\\",\\\
  \\\"\\\\\\\"The function os.pullEvent() will yield the program until a system event occurs. The first return value is the event name, followed by any arguments.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Some events which can occur are:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"char\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" when text is typed on the keyboard. Argument is the character typed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"key\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" when a key is pressed on the keyboard. Arguments are the keycode and whether the key is a repeat. Compare the keycode to the values in keys API to see which key was pressed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"key_up\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" when a key is released on the keyboard. Argument is the numerical keycode. Compare to the values in keys API to see which key was released.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"paste\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" when text is pasted from the users keyboard. Argument is the line of text pasted.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
